                    About Me

                    I work as a reservoir engineer in a depletion management squad focused on managing the decline of the gas field safely
                    and effectively. Furthermore, I work on evaluating wellwork options, infill wells, and near
                    field exploration wells aimed at increasing the life of the field.
                    <br>
                    To accomplish this I use both classical and deterministic methods aligned with appropriate subsurface, and steel assumptions
                    as well as bespoke and self-made probabilistic methods to incorporate the appropriate range of uncertainty.
                    The probabilistic methods are classical methods adjusted to be run as monte carlo simulations and integration with industry-standard
                    software.
                    <br>
                    Outside of work I enjoy creating personal coding projects such as building video games, making music, and engaging in various sports,
                    my favourite being football.
